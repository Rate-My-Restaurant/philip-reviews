X  1. Make sure API routes are correct (README only): README.md
2. make sure Schema is correct
  a. mongo: database/mongo/schema.js
  b. postgres: database/postgres/schema.sql
(finish w step 2 by saturday)

X 3. figure out how to seed the postgres with CSV file
  a. make a csv w 1k records for postgres (get done by tonight)

  b. research how to put csv into a db
  c. do it?
  d. make a csv w 100k records for postgres
  e. do it
  f. 1mm
  g. 10mm (or for how many you need)
  h. all tables at 1k
  g. all tables at full value
  test this an scale it on one table.  But you will have to do it for all tables.
  (finish by monday)


4. figure out how to seed the MongoDB with JSON file (mongo)
  maybe drive w mongoose.
  try csv or JSON try a couple ways at 1k, see how long they take, and scale up.
  this might require writing some functions.

  NOTE: you could (instead of mongoose) use a native javascript driver (not an ORM, so faster)

5. figure out how to query the db and optimize those queries.
  a. write queries in postgres (DUES TUESDAY)
     write queiries in mongo

  b. optimize queries (both mongo and postgres)
    - indexing: organize data so that the data that likely meets criteria is in one place (at the top?)
    - make environment better (database configuration options)
    - write better queries


6. choose a db and justify it.
7. finish building all methods
8. finish building all API route
